<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Device (VAD)</li><li>Total Artificial Heart</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial heart market primarily includes two key types: Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) and Total Artificial Hearts. VADs are mechanical pumps that support heart function by assisting one or both ventricles, commonly used for patients awaiting transplants or with severe heart failure. In contrast, Total Artificial Hearts are designed to completely replace the native heart, suitable for patients with advanced heart disease when a transplant is not feasible. Both types aim to improve quality of life and extend survival for affected patients.</p></p>
