<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-expandable</li><li>Self-expandable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral vascular stents market is primarily categorized into two types: balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents. Balloon-expandable stents are deployed using a balloon catheter, which is inflated to expand the stent against the vessel wall, providing a firm fit. In contrast, self-expandable stents utilize a material that naturally expands upon deployment, allowing for adaptability to different vessel sizes and shapes. Both types are crucial for treating vascular diseases, improving blood flow, and reducing complications associated with narrow or blocked arteries.</p></p>
