<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spelled Arrestor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-line</li><li>End-of-line</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Spelled Arrestor market is primarily categorized into two types: in-line and end-of-line. In-line arrestors are installed directly within the electrical circuit, providing protection against voltage spikes by diverting excess energy. End-of-line arrestors, on the other hand, are positioned at the end of a circuit, serving as a final defense mechanism against transients before they reach sensitive equipment. Both types are essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of electrical systems by mitigating the risks associated with voltage surges.</p></p>
