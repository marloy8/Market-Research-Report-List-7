<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transcatheter Heart Valves</li><li>Tissue Heart Valves</li><li>Mechanical Heart Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart valve market comprises three main types: transcatheter heart valves, tissue heart valves, and mechanical heart valves. Transcatheter heart valves are minimally invasive devices inserted via catheters, ideal for high-risk patients. Tissue heart valves, made from biological materials, are favored for their natural compatibility and lower thrombosis risk but may require replacement over time. Mechanical heart valves, constructed from durable materials, offer longevity but necessitate lifelong anticoagulation therapy due to a higher risk of blood clots. Each type serves distinct patient needs.</p></p>
